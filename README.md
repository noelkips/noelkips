✨ What Inspires Me
The future of food lies in smart, connected systems — and that’s where my passion begins. I’m driven by the power of backend engineering to reshape agriculture, especially for communities that have long been underserved. From crafting APIs that monitor crop health to integrating seamless payment systems for rural farmers, I believe backend solutions can bridge the gap between traditional farming and tomorrow’s technology.

My mission is to empower farmers to maximize their yields, streamline day-to-day operations, and connect with broader, better markets — all through scalable, intelligent digital tools. Every farmer, no matter how remote, deserves access to technology that uplifts — and I’m committed to building those tools that turn that vision into reality.

## 🎓 Programs I’m Enrolled In

- **ALX Backend Program**  
- **ProDev Backend Program**

These programs are project-based and foster collaboration with peers, mentors, and industry professionals. I joined software engineering to upscale my technical skills, connect meaningfully, and solve real-world problems — especially in agriculture and rural development.
