## 🌱 About Me

I'm currently a learner in the **ALX Backend Engineering** and **ProDev Backend** programs. These project-based learning experiences have connected me with mentors, peers, and industry experts. The structured curriculum, hands-on projects, and continuous collaboration are shaping my journey toward becoming a professional backend engineer.

💡 **Why Software Engineering?**  
I chose this path because I'm inspired by the power of code to solve real-world problems. I'm especially driven to contribute solutions in **agritech**, where I believe technology can greatly improve efficiency, transparency, and sustainability in agriculture.

🎯 **My Goal:**  
To apply the skills gained from ALX and ProDev to build scalable, secure, and impactful backend systems, and contribute meaningfully to open-source and enterprise projects.
